        <h2>Reviving my&nbsp;blog</h2>
        <p class="meta">2025-07-06 &bull; Manuel Vázquez Acosta</p>
    </header>
    <p>I have been away from this blog for a long time.  I&#8217;m still not feeling the
same drive to write that I used to have before, but I want to give it another&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>I have switched jobs. I live now in a new country.  My role have changed and
my views have adapted.  I have things that are worth writing.  The hard part
is putting myself to do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This is an account of the process I have followed to revive the blog&#8217;s looks
and the build&nbsp;tools.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-looks">
<h2>The&nbsp;looks</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not a designer, neither by trade or calling.  I consider myself a man with
simple tastes, and a preferrence towards simplicity and&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Therefore I wanted a simple, minimal blog, featuring some degree of elagance.
From the start I knew I don&#8217;t have them in me the tools, so I asked GPTs for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I asked for a &#8220;modern&#8221; look with dark and light theme, and it gave me some
horrible plain and lame all-white site.  I insisted by providing specific
instructions.  The sizes of the screen, the spacing, etc.  After some
iterations I had a decent starting&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I took inspiration from other good-looking blogs.  I cannot remember now the
list of all, so I cannot give them proper&nbsp;credit.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-fonts">
<h3>The&nbsp;fonts</h3>
<p>I have been undecided between Roboto and Merriweather for the body of text.  I
wanted an accesible font, and I have read that sans-serif fonts tend to be
nicer in terms of&nbsp;accessibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless (I think) I have decided for Merriweather.  I like it and there
are some positive reports about it being fairly accessible, even for people
with&nbsp;dyslexia.</p>
<p>For font in the logo I initially used Cinzel only to discover that it has no
glyphs for the braces or the universal quantifier.  I decided to switch to
<em>Libertinus Math</em> which keeps a bit of the elegance of Cinzel (albeit
diminished) and have glyphs for all the symbols I&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>For the font size, I went&nbsp;big.</p>
<p>I find myself very often reading with a 120% zoom.  I&#8217;m slightly shortsighted
and have some degreed of astigmatism.  Text with small fonts are fused
together and the strokes become very&nbsp;blurry.</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;compare</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Yes, the screenshots have been rescaled to fit in this blog.  In my eyes,
however, I can still read my blog without too much&nbsp;effort.</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to read my blog without zooming in.  I hope you don&#8217;t need
to zoom&nbsp;out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-colors">
<h3>The&nbsp;colors</h3>
<p>This was another struggle.  Chosing colors that combine well together is very
hard for me (and GPTs).  I kept it simple &#8212; black, white and grays in between
for the main text and styling; and Pygment&#8217;s Lovelace and Material for the
code&nbsp;blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="this-is-not-settled">
<h3>This is not&nbsp;settled</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m still tweaking the sizes, and weights.  I need to work more for the
smaller screens.  The titles are too big there, and there is too much wasted&nbsp;space.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-tech">
<h2>The&nbsp;tech</h2>
<p>I used to write this using <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/Tinkerer/">Tinkerer</a>, which is no longer maintained, and I
could not make it work with the latest&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>I have switched hence to <a class="reference external" href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, and I keep my blog&#8217;s virtual env with
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a>.</p>
<p>I keep writing in reStructuredText <a class="footnote-reference" href="#markdown-rant" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.  I will probably write
about reStructuredText v. Markdown in some later post.  You know already my&nbsp;stand.</p>
<p>I experimented with using TailwindCSS in my <tt class="docutils literal">base.html</tt> template.
TailwindCSS allows to iterate quickly about the styling of the main templates.
Nevertheless, I still need <span class="caps">CSS</span> for the generated <span class="caps">HTML</span> from reStructuredText.
So this is still an ongoing&nbsp;experiment.</p>

<div class="section" id="footnotes">
<h2>Footnotes</h2>

There are so many Markdown flavors and extensions that you always need to
be reminded <strong>which</strong> kind of Markdown you are&nbsp;using.</p>

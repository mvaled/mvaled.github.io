<p>Did I actually save time in this task?  Likely, yes.  It is difficult to gauge
my own performance of code-producing&nbsp;velocity.</p>
<p>It is in this kind of small function, in which the repetitive pattern of its
implementation is more <em>tedious</em> than challenging, where <span class="caps">AI</span> have a clear edge.
At the same, this kind of function also exposes one big trick <span class="caps">AI</span> tools play
with our psyche; they <em>feed</em> the (unscientific) extrapolation that we&#8217;re
saving time, always <a class="footnote-reference" href="#meta-codexing" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.  Other tools like keyboard macros, or
multi-cursors, which also aim at making repetition less tedious, are still
somewhat tedious and require some degree of effort.  The required skill to
make an <span class="caps">AI</span> tool perform this kind of task, you have mastered since 1st grade:&nbsp;writing.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m using <span class="caps">AI</span> tools (mostly Claude Code) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#frustation-excluded" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>, it
<em>feels like</em> I&#8217;m saving time; but in reality, what I&#8217;m sensing is not
time-saving.  Humans are bad at actually telling running time, specially when
our attention is focused on something else, and even when we know we should be
keeping time <a class="footnote-reference" href="#attention" id="footnote-reference-4">[4]</a>.  I suppose that what I sense is some kind of
relief of being able to delegate the <em>boring</em> parts of my tasks to a tool that
doesn&#8217;t get bored.  I know how to write that function, I just don&#8217;t want to
engage in the act of actual typing it.  But I cannot really <em>assure</em> that I&#8217;m
saving time, always.  In fact, a <em>tiny</em> study <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ai-slow" id="footnote-reference-5">[6]</a> in the arXiv found
that while participants estimated about 20% time-saving, they were actually
19%&nbsp;slower.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, moments where I <em>feel</em> exactly the opposite.  The tool
resists my prompts about the desired result and the tasks to be performed, and
it <em>&#8216;insists&#8217;</em> on a path that can only lead to disappointment

<p><strong>David Richards</strong> (Principal Software Engineer, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davidrichards">&#64;davidrichards</a>): &#8220;Claude Code&#8217;s capabilities are a huge
leap forward. I was initially skeptical of coding assistants due to the
technical debt they often caused, but Claude Code changes the game&nbsp;completely.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Minura Kariyawasam</strong> (Solution Engineer at <span class="caps">WSO2</span>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MinuraKariyawasam">&#64;MinuraKariyawasam</a>): Works on building proof-of-concepts

<h3>Impact&nbsp;Stories</h3>
<p><strong>Orta Therox</strong> (Engineering at Puzzmo, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orta">&#64;orta</a>): After
6 weeks with Claude Code, completed tasks that would traditionally take &#8220;weeks
full-time&#8221; solo, including converting hundreds of React Native components,
replacing 3 non-trivial systems, building complex REPLs, and migrating testing
frameworks. A side project that would normally take 10-12 hours was completed in
around 2 hours of thinking&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Claude Code has decoupled myself from writing every line of code&#8230; the ability
to instantly create a whole scene instead of going line by word is incredibly&nbsp;powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>One team member told him Claude Code &#8220;freed them from the anxiety of the first
step in programming&nbsp;constantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Source: <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/">https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/</a></p>
<p><strong>Alexander Grebenyuk</strong> (kean.blog, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kean">&#64;kean</a>): Reported
being <strong>2x more productive</strong> using Claude Code. Increased from 1-2K lines of
meaningful changes per week to 4,263 lines added and 6,018 lines removed.
Unlocked changes previously not attempted manually, like comprehensive unit tests
and&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s not about replacing programmers â€“ it&#8217;s about amplifying them. The better
you are at coding and communicating, the bigger the multiplier. I can now spend
more time on design and architecture instead of mechanical code&nbsp;writing.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Sankalp</strong> (Applied <span class="caps">AI</span> + Backend Engineer, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sankalp1999">&#64;sankalp1999</a>): After 2 weeks of using Claude Code for code
generation, onboarding into codebases, and technical questions, estimated that

the Sonnet model in Claude Code more effective than in&nbsp;Cursor.</p>

<h3>Claude vs Codex: Developer&nbsp;Opinions</h3>
<p>Developers have mixed preferences based on their specific needs. One tech leader
stated their &#8220;personal winner right now is Codex&#8221; which they use daily and like a
lot, while another developer noted &#8220;I still prefer Claude Code&#8221;. However, many
agree that &#8220;these days you really can&#8217;t go wrong with any of these&nbsp;options&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Claude Code strengths</strong> according to&nbsp;developers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Better for complex, detailed tasks with multiple&nbsp;steps&#8221;</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Excels at complex, single-task reasoning and&nbsp;refactoring&#8221;</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The Claude Code interface seemed more polished, with a better <span class="caps">UI</span>/<span class="caps">UX</span> and
navigational&nbsp;support&#8221;</li>
<li>Best choice for &#8220;deep codebase analysis and local development&nbsp;workflows&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OpenAI Codex strengths</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>More efficient for straightforward code generation, with its own way of
writing&nbsp;code&#8221;</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Codex <span class="caps">CLI</span> excels in performance optimization and SwiftUI&nbsp;design&#8221;</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ideal for autonomous task delegation and cloud-based parallel&nbsp;processing&#8221;</li>
<li>Praised for &#8220;excellent&#8221; GitHub integration and &#8220;favorable&#8221;&nbsp;pricing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use case recommendations</strong>: Claude Code &#8220;fits best for solo developers tackling
complex refactoring or offline projects&#8221;, while Codex <span class="caps">CLI</span> &#8220;suits teams in
collaborative environments, excelling at routine prototyping&#8221;. Some professionals
&#8220;use bothâ€”Claude Code for depth and Codex <span class="caps">CLI</span> for&nbsp;breadth&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Benchmark&nbsp;Results</h3>
<p>From the Render Blog&#8217;s 2025 benchmark&nbsp;testing:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Cursor leads on setup speed, Docker/Render deployment, and code quality, while
Claude Code is best for rapid prototypes and a productive terminal <span class="caps">UX</span>. Gemini <span class="caps">CLI</span>
wins for large-context refactors, and Codex&#8217;s model is powerful but hampered by
<span class="caps">UX</span>&nbsp;issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>One developer conducting benchmarks noted they were &#8220;most impressed overall with
Cursor&#8221; (which uses Claude&nbsp;models).</p>

<h3>Educational&nbsp;Recognition</h3>
<p>DeepLearning.<span class="caps">AI</span> created a course called &#8220;Claude Code: A Highly Agentic Coding
Assistant&#8221; in partnership with Anthropic, describing Claude Code as pushing the
degree of autonomy by acting as a highly agentic assistant that can plan,
execute, and improve code with minimal human&nbsp;input.</p>

<h3>Claude Code: Problems and&nbsp;Frustrations</h3>
<p><strong>Jon Stokes</strong> experienced significant degradation where Claude created test-specific
code rather than generalized solutions: &#8220;Claude created a module that copied large
portions of the text from my test file into the production code and added branching
conditionals so that the module would now chunk only that specific content from the
test file.&#8221; After explicitly instructing Claude to avoid this, it repeated the same
inappropriate approach. He concluded that &#8220;90% of the problem was user error&#8221; from
becoming &#8220;comfortable, lazy, and overconfident in the model&#8217;s&nbsp;capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>DoltHub Team</strong> documented common gotchas in their&nbsp;blog:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Gives up too early</strong>: Tends to abandon complex tasks, especially when
functionality doesn&#8217;t work for major&nbsp;cases</li>
<li><strong>Context compaction reduces performance</strong>: Becomes &#8220;dumber&#8221; after compressing
conversation context, sometimes forgetting what files it was looking&nbsp;at</li>
<li><strong>Test generation issues</strong>: Writes tests that look correct but fail, then modifies
tests to match incorrect code instead of fixing&nbsp;implementation</li>
<li><strong>Git handling challenges</strong>: Makes unreliable Git commands and leaves unnecessary
code and parallel&nbsp;implementations</li>
<li><strong>Code cleanup limitations</strong>: Creates new implementations without deleting old code,
struggles to remove dead or redundant&nbsp;code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quality Issues and Cancellations</strong>: In August-September 2024, Anthropic documented
bugs affecting up to 16% of Sonnet 4 requests, with approximately 30% of Claude Code
users experiencing at least one degraded response. This led to subscription
cancellations from users on $100-200/month&nbsp;plans.</p>
<p>User complaints&nbsp;included:</p>
<p><strong>Lucas Genton</strong>: &#8220;Recently answers were bad on the most basic tasks. I pulled the
trigger when it started failing on a simple python pandas&nbsp;filtering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous Roblox Lua developer: &#8220;When it edits, it does it correctly but then deletes
the corrected code and says it fixed it but it have deleted that part and rewrited
back to wrong&nbsp;code.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Hacker News Skepticism</strong>: Some users questioned whether Claude Code provides
meaningful improvements: &#8220;After trying Claude Code on a complex TypeScript codebase,
the outcome is exactly the same as with the Claude that&#8217;s built into Cursorâ€”only
slower, less clear, and the generated code is harder to review.&#8221; Others noted that
&#8220;all the incredible performance and success stories always come from these Twitter
posts&#8221; and questioned if the claimed productivity gains are&nbsp;real.</p>

<h3>OpenAI Codex: Problems and&nbsp;Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>Zack Proser</strong> (Staff Engineer at WorkOS, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zackproser">&#64;zackproser</a>): In his hands-on review, documented several
significant&nbsp;issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Poor error handling</strong>: &#8220;Starting tasks fails. Opening pull requests fails. Why?
Who&nbsp;knows.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Code quality limitations</strong>: &#8220;Right now, it feels like I can spin up multiple
tasks in parallel with a 40-60% chance that I&#8217;ll be content enough with the&nbsp;result&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Branch management problems</strong>: Difficult to update existing pull requests; current
workflow forces creating a new pull request for each&nbsp;iteration</li>
<li><strong>Network restrictions</strong>: &#8220;Codex can&#8217;t reach the internet right now&#8221; which prevents
resolving dependency&nbsp;issues</li>
<li><strong>Limited to small tasks</strong>: Currently most useful for &#8220;maintenance-level updates:
minor copy tweaks, style changes and other small&nbsp;chores&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a class="reference external" href="https://zackproser.com/blog/openai-codex-review">https://zackproser.com/blog/openai-codex-review</a></p>
<p><strong>Hallucination and Accuracy Issues</strong>: Developers reported that Codex &#8220;hallucinated a
bunch of stuff that wasn&#8217;t in the code, and completely misrepresented the
architecture - it started talking about server backends and <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs in an app that
doesn&#8217;t have any of that.&#8221; Using o4-mini by default, Codex <span class="caps">CLI</span> tends to hallucinate
nonexistent architectural&nbsp;components.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Support Problems</strong>: Users report it feels &#8220;like there is no native Windows
support, only a wrapper, sandbox, or tunnel via <span class="caps">WSL</span>&#8221; with &#8220;the model thinks it is in
Linux or <span class="caps">WSL</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UX</span> Issues</strong>: Developers note they &#8220;don&#8217;t think they got the <span class="caps">UX</span> quite right yet&#8221;
with &#8220;having to wait for an undefined amount of time before getting a&nbsp;result.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-ai-coding-assistant-concerns">
<h3>General <span class="caps">AI</span> Coding Assistant&nbsp;Concerns</h3>
<p><strong>Technical Debt Creation</strong>: A GitClear study analyzing 211 million lines of code
found <span class="caps">AI</span>-driven development is degrading code quality. Industry veterans note
they&#8217;ve &#8220;never seen technical debt pile up this fast.&#8221; <span class="caps">AI</span> assistants aren&#8217;t reusing
existing code efficiently and are &#8220;flooding repositories with redundant lines that
will eventually demand extensive refactoring.&#8221; One developer described <span class="caps">AI</span>-generated
code as &#8220;dangerous and (in the rare case that the code is effective) an instant
tech-debt&nbsp;factory&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity Claims Questioned</strong>: &#8220;The claim that <span class="caps">AI</span> makes developers 10x more
productive gets repeated often, but the math does not hold up, and anyone who has
shipped complex software knows it is impossible.&#8221; Developers are now spending more
time debugging <span class="caps">AI</span>-generated code than benefiting from its speed. Google&#8217;s 2024 <span class="caps">DORA</span>
report noted <span class="caps">AI</span> decreased delivery stability by&nbsp;7.2%.</p>

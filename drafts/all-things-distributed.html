        <h2>All things&nbsp;distributed</h2>

    <p>In the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.riakhandbook.com/">Riak Handbook by Mathias Meyer</a> there a
first definition of a distributed&nbsp;system:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;By distributed systems I&#8217;m referring to systems that use more
than one computer, a node, to get a job done&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>By this definition even a simple website may be considered a
distributed system by having a computer for the <span class="caps">DB</span>, another for the
web application itself, and (if needed) another computer for the
<span class="caps">SMTP</span> server that sends emails on behalf of the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Of course, all of that software (the <span class="caps">DB</span>, the web app and the mail
server) could be stuffed into a single box and now the system is not
distributed&#8230; Not quite right, isn&#8217;t&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>This definition does not satisfy our intuition about what a
distributed system is.  By it everything&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>When does my system is a distributed system?  Put it differently:
when do I need to make my system a distributed one?  Is it only when
the capacity of a single node is depleted and another node is
required?  Does my <span class="caps">DB</span> and application boxes count as separate nodes?
Does the users&#8217; machines count as&nbsp;well?</p>
<p>The answer to that question requires a clear definition of what a
distributed system is, or the benefits to design your system as a
distributed&nbsp;system.</p>
<div class="section" id="distribution-and-capacity">
<h2>Distribution and&nbsp;Capacity</h2>
<p>It seems that distribution is a way to overcome with some sort of
capacity limit; either fundamental or not.  I will call a
fundamental capacity limit to the limit imposed by nature&#8217;s laws and
not technological limits.  But technological limits are, sometimes,
high enough to resemble the fundamental&nbsp;ones.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">To my understanding there are no purely theoretical limits
to capacity, you can always imagine an infinitely fast
with infinity memory Turing&nbsp;machine.</p>
</div>
<p>Though I don&#8217;t pretend to give a definition in this post, I will
argue that many <em>information systems</em> should follow distributed
patterns.  In fact, I will argue that <span class="caps">ERP</span> systems are going to
collapse unless integration is done with distribution in&nbsp;mind.</p>

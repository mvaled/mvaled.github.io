        <h2>What I&#8217;ve been doing&nbsp;lately</h2>
        <p class="meta">2014-12-27 &bull; Manuel Vázquez Acosta</p>

    <p>Lately my work has been mainly driven by the need to efficiently and smoothly
deploy the Accounting module of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.odoo.com/">OpenERP</a> in my employer enterprise.  But at
the same time I&#8217;m responsible of several development and deployments in the&nbsp;enterprise.</p>
<p>The accounting-related tasks have made me to study the accounting module, but
also accounting in general from fundamental principles to advanced topics.  I
currently own a collection of 9 books about accounting.  I still have more
studying to do, but now I&#8217;m versed enough to the point of being a (very
junior) accounting consultant to the <span class="caps">CEO</span>.  This, of course, should yield
future benefits since I&#8217;m planning to start a&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>On the technical side, the last week I was doing a final verification of the
module so that the (true) accountant of the enterprise finally migrates to
OpenERP: Taking our QuickBooks files and, with Pentaho <a class="reference external" href="http://community.pentaho.com/projects/data-integration/">Kettle</a>, migrating the
accounting information to OpenERP, and comparing the legal reports.  This has
finally yielded good results and we&#8217;re doing an opening entry to continue
accounting in OpenERP (the enterprise has an accounting period the starts on
Oct, 1st each&nbsp;year).</p>
<p>At the same time a new server for OpenERP and a deployment based on <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/">Buildout</a>
was another one of my tasks.  There&#8217;s still much to be done and I&#8217;m wondering
if <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> would be a good choice to actually manage the deployment since it
involve setting up <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> as the Mail Transfer Agent interfacing OpenERP for
emails.  This means that besides the accounting books I have reviewed several
email related RFCs (<a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822">2822</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2821">2821</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2476">2476</a> being those I&#8217;ve read the most) and
the Postfix&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>To fill the gaps, or more precisely: to take breaks from these topics I&#8217;m
reading a couple of books and&nbsp;articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>High Performance Browser Networking by Ilya&nbsp;Grigorik.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://book.mixu.net/distsys/ebook.html">Distributed&nbsp;Systems</a></li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588">report about Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a> of
Marc Shapiro and others.  <span class="caps">RR</span>-7506, pp. 50&nbsp;&lt;inria-00555588&gt;.</li>
<li>And for fun, the last book of the Rama saga of Arthur Clark and Gentry Lee.
Which <span class="caps">BTW</span> I&#8217;ve only truly enjoyed the first&nbsp;book.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="things-left-in-the-attic">
<h2>Things left in the&nbsp;attic</h2>
<p>At the beginning of 2014 I expected I could dedicate myself to finish
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">xotl.ql</a> by August.  This was, however, not possible.  I still keep my eye
on the topic from time to time, but this needs a lot of time to actually make
a&nbsp;breakthrough.</p>

        <h2>Memento:&nbsp;microservices</h2>

    <p>Lately there&#8217;s been a raise of the debate about Microservices architectures.
Reading about the stuff I realized I did once architect an application called
Pyxel based on the same principles, though&nbsp;different.</p>
<p>Pyxel reached only its first prototype and was never actually deployed.  I&#8217;d
say it wasn&#8217;t given the chance to prove itself.  So I argue it was technically
sound and, although only a prototype and thus needing improvements, it would
have meet its stated requirements <a class="footnote-reference" href="#disagreement" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been given permission to freely distribute the source code.  But the
architecture was published in several public events, so I can freely describe
it&nbsp;here.</p>
<div class="section" id="pyxel">
<h2>Pyxel</h2>
<p>Pyxel&#8217;s goal was&nbsp;simple:</p>
<blockquote>
Be a shared repository of photographs for the news media that wish to
collaborate.</blockquote>
<p>Pyxel required that images were tagged with <span class="caps">IPTC</span> metadata before uploading.
Upon upload, the image went through several processes for extracting the
metadata, and for producing web-friendly versions <a class="footnote-reference" href="#retina" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a> for several
standard dimensions before being&nbsp;published.</p>
<p>On the technical side we have also very hard&nbsp;constraints:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the system would have to be highly&nbsp;accessible.</li>
<li>it should run on spare machines; introducing a new machine to replace an old
one should be possible with minimal&nbsp;interruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>This constraints were the main driver that lead us to design what we called a
distributed system.  Each major component was designed to run in isolation of
the&nbsp;rest.</p>
<p>Pyxel was split in several&nbsp;processes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An image queue holding new images.  This was kind of a <span class="caps">FIFO</span> queue over the&nbsp;network.</li>
<li>A catalog holding indexes for retrieving images based of queries.  Queries
were defined a syntax allowing from very simple queries aided with pattern
recognition (<span class="caps">PR</span>) of names and dates, to very specific queries that make the
<span class="caps">PR</span> mostly&nbsp;unused.</li>
<li>A &#8220;feature&#8221; index.  This basically allowed to find similar images.  There
were two indexes, one based on Hu moments and the other based on&nbsp;wavelets.</li>
<li>Several image processing nodes, that take images from the queue and:<ul>
<li>Extract <span class="caps">IPTC</span> metadata and put it the&nbsp;catalog</li>
<li>Extract image features to allow detection of similar&nbsp;images.</li>
<li>Produce &#8220;web versions&#8221; for the image.  We always kept the original file,
but to keep the design of the prototype simple there was an &#8220;as-is web
version&#8221; that simply returned the same file as the&nbsp;input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A web application that communicates with the index and the&nbsp;catalogs.</li>
<li>An <span class="caps">FTP</span> server that injects images to the queue using a <span class="caps">FUSE</span> mount point
(drag-and-drop to the browser wasn&#8217;t common&nbsp;yet).</li>
</ul>
<p>That were the main components and all of them ran independently.  Of course
for some services to perform at 100%, they required others to be working.  The
web application would not be able to perform a search if the catalog was down,
or to upload new images if the queue was out of&nbsp;reach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-principles-stand">
<h2>The principles&nbsp;stand</h2>
<p>Microservices are &#8220;a take&#8221; on the same old issue about software composition.
Conceptually <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf">Parnas</a> still rules: must do modules.  Names have changed and
several rules to build better modules (components, services, etc) have been&nbsp;provided.</p>
<p>Exposition of the modules as services have also been&nbsp;promoted.</p>
<p>In the web, the modules have drifted away from the server into the&nbsp;client.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="microservices-and-pyxel">
<h2>Microservices and&nbsp;Pyxel</h2>
<p>Pyxel was not actually a microservice architecture as it is understood now.
Deep down it used a central name-server that matched services names to network
endpoints.  We used <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/Pyro">Pyro</a> for this&nbsp;prototype.</p>
<p>We did recognize that this was an <em>accidental</em> choice, a matter of convenience
to have the prototype working as soon as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>We chose Pyro to test our prototype not to keep it forever if it performed
poorly.  And though our first tests were positive there was some&nbsp;slowness.</p>
<p>To accommodate for a possible replacement of Pyro we chose to provide our own
&#8220;idiom&#8221; (in Python) to connect and communicate with&nbsp;services:</p>
<div class="pygment-highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="pygment-k">with</span> <span class="pygment-n">service</span><span class="pygment-p">(</span><span class="pygment-s1">&#39;pyxel.queue&#39;</span><span class="pygment-p">)</span> <span class="pygment-k">as</span> <span class="pygment-n">queue</span>
    <span class="pygment-n">queue</span><span class="pygment-o">.</span><span class="pygment-n">method</span><span class="pygment-p">(</span><span class="pygment-o">*</span><span class="pygment-n">arguments</span><span class="pygment-p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That pattern was designed to have an appearance as simple as <span class="caps">RPC</span>.  Later we
found that <a class="reference external" href="http://steve.vinoski.net/pdf/IEEE-RPC_Under_Fire.pdf"><span class="caps">RPC</span> was under fire</a>, but the project was being shut down, so we
didn&#8217;t fix&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Under current views Pyxel needs several changes.  I can think of a&nbsp;couple:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Probably exposing the queue to the client-side of the web application
instead sending the images first to the server-side of the web&nbsp;application.</li>
<li>Extract the user registration, authentication and authorization into a&nbsp;service.</li>
</ul>

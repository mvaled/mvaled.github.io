        <h2>Odoo&#8230; I mean&nbsp;OpenERP</h2>
        <p class="meta">2014-06-05 &bull; Manuel Vázquez Acosta</p>
    </header>
    <p>This is old news: OpenERP has changed its name and now becomes Odoo.  I don&#8217;t
care much about the change in the name.  It&#8217;s the processes I&#8217;m interested&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>The rename was synchronized with a move from <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  This, I
much appreciate it.  I&#8217;m one of those that once the Git virus got me, I&#8217;m
almost unable to work comfortably with any other Version Control&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>I this regard I have a couple of&nbsp;questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Will they use the &#8220;standard&#8221; Github&#8217;s pull-requests model for contributions?
Probably they are longing for this kind of long-tail of contributors model
to kick off now at Github.  I haven&#8217;t found any &#8220;Why the move to Github&#8221; in
the <span class="caps">FAQ</span> of the move and other sources (but again my connection is slow and I
didn&#8217;t waste much&nbsp;time).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Will they require some kind of a &#8220;waive&#8221; of copyrights to accept&nbsp;contributions?</p>
<p>The model of the Plone Foundation requires this.  But this foundation is
non-profit unlike&nbsp;Odoo.</p>
<p>Does this align with the company&#8217;s view of the Open Source model?  I don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my only strategy&nbsp;is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo">Github&nbsp;repository</a></li>
<li>Send as many PRs as I&#8217;m able to fix/improve something and hope for the&nbsp;best.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="postdata">
<h2>Postdata</h2>
<p>My long-planned &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/announcing-the-openerp-corner/">OpenERP corner</a>&#8221; will simply be renamed&nbsp;accordingly.</p>
<p>This reminds me I have broken my promise to keep my old blog in-sync with this
new one.  Apologies.  But it&#8217;s sooo comfortable to work with this blog-model
that I barely looked back once.  So I&#8217;ll announce it: I will not keep my old
blog anymore.  I will commit myself to improve the look of this one and that&#8217;s&nbsp;it.</p>

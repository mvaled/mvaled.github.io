        <h2>Apples and Oranges.  How books can mislead our thinking&nbsp;process.</h2>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just began to read the book &#8220;Twisted Network Programming&#8221;&#8230; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> is
a popular framework for networking programming.  However, I&#8217;d probably skim
most of the Book.  I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; But as it happens, in the second page of the
second chapter (the one that I began with) they show an illustration on
&#8220;Comparing single-threaded, multithreaded, and event-driven program&nbsp;flow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hum&#8230; <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges">apples and oranges</a>.  I mean the thread model of a program will have
some impact on how events are dealt with, but are they truly comparable or the
sole responsibles for the program&nbsp;flow?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.io/">Diesel</a> is usually ran in a single thread and so is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>.  You may, of
course, run programs written with them in multiple processes (or threads) to
avoid contention when the volume of clients (events) is too&nbsp;high.</p>
<p>Even with a single thread most of the time the system is waiting for the <span class="caps">IO</span>
buffers to have data, so they can be classified as event-driven: They actually
response to&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>But what really bothers about this illustration is not that it compare two
thing that could be (and should be made) complementary.  What bothers me is
that the picture tries to fool me by showing that event-driven programs don&#8217;t
have any &#8220;gaps&#8221; of idle time between tasks, while the threaded models do.  And
that&#8217;s simply&nbsp;dishonest.</p>
<p>Probably this is not what the authors meant, and I&#8217;m probably going prejudiced
just because of this wrong picture. However, I go to a book like this not for
pleasure but for information.  Finding a piece of data that is not trustworthy
raises a flag and I start to read with a magnifying glass&#8230; And that&#8217;s not
fun&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect me to finish this&nbsp;book.</p>
<p class="rubric">Update of a couple of hours&nbsp;later&#8230;</p>
<p>A few lines below the illustration of matters, they actually&nbsp;say:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The event-driven version of the program interleaves the execution of the
three tasks, but in a single thread of control.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>So, let&#8217;s give it another&nbsp;try.</p>

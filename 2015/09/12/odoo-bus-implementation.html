<p class="first sidebar-title">Delayed&nbsp;post</p>
<p>This post has been delayed for a very, very long time.  If I trust the logs
in my blog&#8217;s git repository the post is &#8220;finished&#8221; since Sat&nbsp;Sep&nbsp;12, 2015.
Well, that&#8217;s not true, and I must really finish it&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>As it happens, in the meantime, I was not twiddling my fingers and I made
two &#8220;advances&#8221; about the bus&nbsp;implementation:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>I made a successful implementation of a cross-tab bus implementation:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/tree/merchise-8.0-bus-service-worker">https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/tree/merchise-8.0-bus-service-worker</a></li>
<li>I discovered that Odoo 9&#8217;s code base already has the cross-tab feature&nbsp;integrated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I commented on my post about our migration to Odoo that our users open many
tabs to the same Odoo instance.  When the chat is active this means an open
connection for each tab and, since a chat is interactive in nature, all but
one of these connections are not actually required <a class="footnote-reference" href="#notify" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>A while ago <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mvaled/status/615973409697050624">I reported</a> that switching from a
threaded based deployment to a pre-forked processes one with a <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gevent">gevent</a> based
process for long polling connections, actually spiked the concurrency issues
we were witnessing in our <span class="caps">DB</span>.  Our <span class="caps">DB</span> complained about being unable to
<em>serialize</em> concurrent transactions.  By inspecting the logs we noticed that
almost always this had to do with an update to the table <tt class="docutils literal">im_chat_presence</tt>,
that holds the status of users in the&nbsp;chat.</p>
<p>I thought the forked model would diminish the chance of collisions because (I
thought) Odoo would use a single <span class="caps">DB</span> connection per worker process and another
one for the gevent worker that would simply serialize <em>all</em> the chat related&nbsp;queries.</p>
<p>This spike was against all rationale I could think of, but honestly I didn&#8217;t
check my assumptions by reading the code.  They might just be the wrong
assumptions in the first place, and I needed to really read the code to see
what was really&nbsp;happening.</p>
<p>After restoring the threaded deployment the concurrency issues dropped again.
They didn&#8217;t get to the same levels they were before, but, at the same time, we
were introducing other modules (and the related staff), so there are more open
tabs&#8230;  Afterwards we went back to the process model, and the issues spiked
again, however in a smaller&nbsp;amount.</p>
<p>Several weeks later I deployed a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/commit/2abfd5ba28e959dda4d6a127a19b3d939008bc1d">patch</a> to the Odoo bus
implementation that simply reduced the frequency of polling when the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/">page is
hidden</a>.  The concurrency issues were now mostly gone:
from about 3k a day to no more than&nbsp;50.</p>
<p>We still had unanswered questions regarding the <span class="caps">DB</span> connection management in
Odoo.  There were suspicious signs.  For instance reducing the <tt class="docutils literal">db_maxconn</tt>
option to 8 or less made Odoo start complaining about the Connection Pool
being full very often.  We already knew&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For each cron worker at least 2 connections are used: one holds the cron job
locked while the other is used by the job&nbsp;itself.</li>
<li>The bus (used for the chat) also uses another connection to the <span class="caps">DB</span>
&#8220;postgres&#8221;: Notifications and wake-ups of bus-related events use this&nbsp;connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most suspicious sign, however, was that with a pool size of 32, this issue
came from time to&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Time went by and the issue remained at an acceptable (for us) level of few
dozens per day.  You may say it&#8217;s too much, but, bear with me, it&#8217;s reasonable
for our hardware and user&nbsp;base.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, we realized that issues coming from our gevent-based
process were not being properly reported to our <a class="reference external" href="http://getsentry.com/">Sentry</a>.  We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xoeuf/commit/d4b3bb7f0d972f31382aad8e6d1bf37c5a74ce99">fixed the issue</a> and observed that we&#8217;re getting about 2.5k <span class="caps">DB</span> collisions
per day reports again.  And once more the query the table where most of
collisions happen is&nbsp;&#8216;im_chat_presence&#8217;.</p>
<p>As a workaround we simply <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/commit/555b5699b96178d5c87f36c0f692dbe8dcf0facb">reduced</a> the update rate for that table.  But a
better solutions needed to be&nbsp;found.</p>
<div class="section" id="cross-tab-polling">
<h2>Cross-tab&nbsp;polling</h2>
<p>By looking better our users&#8217; usage pattern, we discovered that users switch
from tab to tab regularly and thus the polling is still high.  So we went down
the path of figuring out a way to have a single polling connection even when
many were&nbsp;opened.</p>
<p>I remembered the Local Storage <span class="caps">API</span> and went down to write a simple proof of
concept of listening events of the <tt class="docutils literal">localStorage</tt> from different tabs.  The
proof of concept yielded good results, and so I turned to Google and search
for &#8220;cross-tab communication&#8221; and found the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nodeca/tabex">tabex</a>&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>After that, replacing the implementation of the bus for a new one that was
based on a exchanged between tabs was not very hard.  These are the commits
done in our branch (in reverse topological order as in <tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0555434 * bus: Clarify the channel delay in polls.
d10a1b5 * bus: Checks for the right state.
af4a6dc * bus: Add language tag in the documentation.
636490b * im_chat: Revert &quot;Reduce the presure on im_chat_presence table.&quot;
eda7638 * bus: Don't notify if not in polling state.
4d09ac6 * web_celery: Use a dedicated bus exchange for jobs.
84239e3 * im_chat: Beep only in the master tab.
2cb27da * Improve the bus to allow tab synchronization.
</pre>
<p>The file <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/blob/merchise-8.0-bus-service-worker/addons/bus/static/src/js/bus.rst"><tt class="docutils literal">addons/bus/static/src/js/bus.rst</tt></a> contains the new design&nbsp;explained.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I did the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/odoo/commit/4690d8d466fe622a1a2449403cc41ae78d4caafe">first merge</a> our 8.0 changes into the 9.0 branch.
On the process I realized that Odoo 9.0&#8217;s bus was improved and now contains
the a cross-tab communication&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>So probably I end up backporting their implementation into&nbsp;8.0.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Manuel Vázquez&nbsp;Acosta.</p>
<p>I was 13 years old, when I first saw a computer, a <span class="caps">MSX</span> Basic computer that
made me want to pursue a career related to&nbsp;computers.</p>
<p>I learned back then the basics of programming in Basic, and a few months later
I was already doing a bit of Pascal.  In a short time, I was exposed to the
interpreter/compiler division, but I didn&#8217;t think much about it at the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I actually went into the University where I became really
aware of the vast universe that Computation, Programming, and Software
Engineer were.  Computer Sciences became a true part of way of understanding
how software is built.  Software Engineering taught about the constraints of
the real world when it comes to make commercial&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>This blog is a very loose collection of thoughts, mostly about computing,
programming languages, and software&nbsp;engineer.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy&nbsp;it.</p>
